# Just Another Clicker

### Concept
Clicker games are based around the idea of buying items and in turn those items make money. For example, in Cookie Clicker, you buy items like grandmas, cookie farms, factories, and so on. Typically these games include upgrades that make your items more effective. These games tend to be a fairly idle game that are great for casual gamers who can open it up, buy a few items, go off and work on something else, and come back later to find that they have enough money to buy something new.

### Why a clicker game?
Clicker games require a good deal of DOM manipulation, specifically event handlers on buttons. To make this project more interesting and have more DOM related practice, I plan on having visuals that update every few seconds. For my clicker, I want to make a battle style clicker. The player would be a hero in which they fight off different enemies to earn gold. The gold they earn can then be used to buy upgrades or hire companions to help defeat enemies more quickly. 

### Win/Lose Logic
Typical clicker games do not directly have the concept of a win or lose. Many clicker game players define a "win" as achieving personal goals such as completing all achievements, earning more than a certain amount of money, having a certain number of companions, etc.

### How to Play
This game is fairly easy to pick up, even for new players. As a user, you will click to buy companions or upgrades. From there, it is simply the joy of watching "battles" and seeing your money grow.
